# Replication of Knockout Blows or the Status Quo

This repo does some replicaton of "[Knockout Blows or the Status Quo? Momentum in the 2016 Primaries](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/703383)" by Joshua D. Clinton, Andrew M. Engelhardt, and Marc J. Trussler, forthcoming *The Journal of Politics*. The Dataverse [entry](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HJ4KH7) does not include all the required data. Marc Trussler kindly provided me with the missing data.

The R code includes a bunch of unfortunate hard-codings. Check the git history to see the changes I had to make. Summary: I just set everything to work in a single directory, at the highest level of the project. I also created the Figures directory, which is hard-coded in their code.

Whoops! There is a problem with the data. Will come back to this once the full survey data is available.
